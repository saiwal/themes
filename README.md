# Custom hubzilla themes for Utsukta hub

## Bootswatched
A bootstrap based theme making use of [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/). Defaults to sketchy, schema selector to be added.

# Install
use the following in your hubzilla root folder to add these themes:

    util/add_theme_repo https://github.com/sk-utsukta/themes.git themes


# Issues:
- themes with names without hyphen do not work, therefor utsukta-default(clone of bootswatched) is used.
- need to make right topnav compact for mobile view.
